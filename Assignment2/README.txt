Water’s exploration

Description
—————————————
This is an animation about the character “Water” exploring his little universe. Water see a butterfly and chases it. They keep flying and he starts to see the most amazing scenery he’s never seen. Suddenly, it goes blank. He can’t see anything. He was scared. He keeps going because he needs to know why. 
And… He realizes…
He’s TRUMAN who has been living inside a dome for his entire life. 

Requirements
———————————————
-Hierarchical object
The main character is a compound shape of a water drop shape, two tetrahedrons, and a sphere. The hierarchical object is its scarf where it moves as the main character moves. The center is at the end of the scarf where it connects to the character’s neck.

-Camera
Using the lookAt() function, I move the camera position accordingly so the angles make the animation look interesting.

-Custom polygonal objects
The head of the main character, and the head of the mushroom are custom shapes that comes from Built_In_Shapes. I used functions to graph the curves to make the shapes. I also made the butterfly using a custom shape. It’s made of two flat triangles in the shape class. I put two of this shape together and animate them to make a moving butterfly.

-Textures
I didn’t use texture mapping due to aesthetics and simplicity of the design of the game. I used custom shading however, to make the scene good looking.
